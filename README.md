## Overview

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) stand as the leading cause of death globally, claiming approximately 17.9 million lives each year. Heart failure, a common consequence of CVDs, significantly contributes to this mortality rate. This project is dedicated to leveraging Machine Learning techniques to predict mortality caused by heart failure, enabling early intervention and tailored patient management strategies. The dataset comprises 12 features predictive of heart failure mortality, aiming to support healtchare professionals in making informed decisions.

## Dataset Description

The dataset includes the next features (12 for prediction and DEATH_EVENT):

- Age: Patient's age, a critical risk factor.
- Anaemia: Presence of anaemia, a condition marked by low hemoglobin levels.
- Creatinine Phosphokinase (CPK): Enzyme levels indicating heart muscle stress.
- Diabetes: Patient's diabetes status, a known risk factor for heart disease.
- Ejection Fraction: Measurement of the heart's efficiency in pumping blood.
- High Blood Pressure: Presence of hypertension, a significant heart disease risk factor.
- Platelets: Blood platelet count, essential for clotting.
- Serum Creatinine: Kidney function indicator, relevant for cardiovascular health.
- Serum Sodium: Levels of sodium in the blood, with imbalances indicating heart failure.
- Sex: Biological sex, influencing heart disease risk and outcomes.
- Smoking: Smoking status, a major cardiovascular risk factor.
- Time: Duration of follow-up, essential for outcome analysis.
- Death Event: Indicates if a heart failure mortality event occurred.

## Project Structure

### Part 1: Data Preparation and Analysis

During this first phase of the project I will be performing several data cleaning queries through MySQL, addressing missing values, outliers and inconsistencies. Now that the data is ready I will enhance the dataset with the creation of new features that will further improve the model and finally create a pipeline that connects this new dataset to Python so I can perform an EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) to uncover patterns and relationships.

Analyzing the dataset through visualization will help uncover patterns, trends, and correlations among the features. This step is critical for understanding the factores that contribute most significantly to heart failure mortality.
